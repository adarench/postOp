### Firebase Project Details
- **Project ID**: `postop-b059e`
- **Web App ID**: `1:559601088062:web:b235679db235fd714dc36f`
- **Hosting URL**: `https://postop-b059e.web.app`
- **Functions URL**: `https://postop-b059e.cloudfunctions.net/`

## ⚠️ What Needs Setup

### 1. Firebase Project Upgrade (Required)
**Status**: Needs Action
**Issue**: Project is on Spark (free) plan, needs Blaze (pay-as-you-go) for Functions

**Action Required**:
1. Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/postop-b059e/usage/details
2. Upgrade to Blaze plan (pay-as-you-go)
3. This enables Cloud Functions, which are essential for the MVP

**Cost**: Very low for pilot - Functions have generous free tier

### 2. Firebase Services Setup
**Status**: Needs Manual Setup

**Actions Required**:
1. **Firestore Database**:
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/postop-b059e/firestore
   - Click "Create database" → Start in production mode
   - Choose `us-central1` region

2. **Firebase Storage**:
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/postop-b059e/storage
   - Click "Get started" → Use default settings

3. **Firebase Authentication**:
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/postop-b059e/authentication
   - Enable Email/Password sign-in method

### 3. Twilio Configuration
**Status**: Needs Twilio Account

**Action Required**:
1. Sign up for Twilio account at https://twilio.com
2. Purchase a phone number for SMS
3. Request HIPAA BAA (Business Associate Agreement)
4. Configure these in Firebase Functions:
   ```bash
   firebase functions:config:set twilio.account_sid="YOUR_SID"
   firebase functions:config:set twilio.auth_token="YOUR_TOKEN"
   firebase functions:config:set twilio.phone_number="YOUR_PHONE"
   firebase functions:config:set twilio.webhook_secret="YOUR_SECRET"
   ```

## 🎯 Deployment Commands (Once Setup Complete)

```bash
# Deploy everything
firebase deploy

# Or deploy individually:
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes  # Database rules
firebase deploy --only functions                          # Backend API
firebase deploy --only hosting                           # Frontend
```

## 🧪 Testing the System

Once deployed, you can test by:
1. Visit: `https://postop-b059e.web.app/onboard`
2. Upload a test CSV with patient data
3. Configure a procedure and schedule
4. Launch monitoring program
5. Test SMS responses using Twilio phone number

## 📊 MVP Features Ready

## 📈 Success Metrics Tracking

The system is configured to track:
- Response rates by patient/day
- Triage distribution (Red/Yellow/Green)
- Staff action metrics
- Call volume reduction estimates
- Early escalation detection

## 🚀 Estimated Setup Time

- **Firebase setup**: 10-15 minutes
- **Twilio setup**: 15-20 minutes
- **Deployment**: 5 minutes
- **First patient upload**: 5 minutes

**Total**: ~45 minutes to full operation

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Upgrade Firebase to Blaze plan
2. **Setup Services**: Enable Firestore, Storage, Auth
3. **Configure Twilio**: Account + phone number + HIPAA BAA
4. **Deploy**: Run deployment commands
5. **Test**: Upload test patients and verify SMS flow
6. **Production**: Begin 30-day pilot with real practice

The system is fully built and ready - just needs the external services configured!
